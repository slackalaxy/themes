One of my all time favourite GTK2 themes is the good old Industrial,
part of the gtk-engines. Unfortunatelly, there is no port to GTK3 and
seems there will not be.

What I do is, let XFCE apply Adwaita for the few GTK3 applications I use
and select a GTK2 theme with a similar colour scheme for the rest. The
colours of the Industrial theme do not match very well Adwaitaâ€™s, so I
decided to modify it.
